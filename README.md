# Phootos

## Overview
Phootos, a stunning Android application designed to explore and discover beautiful images from Unsplash. Phootos leverages modern Android development tools such as the Paging Library, ViewModel, Retrofit, Coroutine Flow, and Jetpack Compose to provide a seamless and delightful user experience.

## Features
- **Explore Unsplash**: Browse through an extensive collection of high-quality images sourced from Unsplash.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Enjoy endless scrolling through images, seamlessly loaded using the Paging Library.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily find images by searching for specific keywords or topics.

## Technologies Used
- **Jetpack Compose**: Used for building the user interface, providing a modern and declarative approach to UI development.
- **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data and communicates with the data layer.
- **Dagger/Hilt**: For dependency injection, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Ensures separation of concerns and maintainability of the codebase.
- **Paging Library**: Promotes a clean separation of layers, making the app more testable and scalable.
  **Room**: Promotes a clean separation of layers, making the app more testable and scalable.

## Architecture Overview
The project follows the principles of Clean Architecture, consisting of three main layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Jetpack Compose components and ViewModels reside here, responsible for rendering UI and handling user interactions.

2. **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic, use cases, and domain models. It's independent of the Android framework.

3. **Data Layer**: Manages data sources, repositories, and network communication. Retrofit is used to fetch data from a remote server.

## Dependencies
- [Dagger/Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): For dependency injection.
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose): For building the UI.
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel): For managing UI-related data.
- [Room]():
- [Paging]():
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines): For handling asynchronous operations.

## Architecture
The app is built using the Modular MVVM architectural pattern and makes heavy use of a couple of Android Jetpack components. MVVM allows for the separation of concern which also makes testing easier.
